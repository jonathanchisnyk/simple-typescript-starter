Forked this repo from a public one that had basic scaffolding for a typescript project

Index.ts file is where tha magic happens, can set up to run many different api calls as you see fit

Basic info:
Axios is the npm package I used for making my api calls, can set up config like some of the variables I have set in the .ts file
Headers, authentication, etc
